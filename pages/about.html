          <p>
            Rusty Browns started out small. Like real small, not big or huge or
            anything like that. Just a small little start, kind of tiny really,
            in the back of this dry cleaner place where clothes got cleaned. The
            kitchen area was not clean-clean but it was there and was a space
            where donut stuff could happen and be made.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, after some time passed and moved on, things started changing
            slowly but also a bit quickly too. One shop became two and then more
            came after those, so the number of shops got bigger over time. We
            made a system type of thing, not super perfect but kind of working
            most of the time, so that more and more people in more places could
            get donuts from us.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea, or maybe more like the plan or goal we had in mind, was
            always the same: to make people smile and feel good and happy from
            eating sweet stuff. Donuts got sugar and they're fried and hot and
            people eat them and feel stuff that is nice to feel. It's just what
            it is and that's how it goes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Donuts from Rusty Brown's isn't just food you eat, it's more than
            just something to chew. It's a food item that is also kind of a
            moment or a feeling or even maybe a little memory that stays. The
            outside is kinda crunchy but not hard-crunchy and the inside is soft
            in a way that's not hard but more like squishy-soft. Some people
            like them, some people like them a lot, and others like them less
            but still maybe kind of like them.
